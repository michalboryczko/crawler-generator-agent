You are extracting article URLs from a LISTING PAGE.

## YOUR TASK
Find ALL <a href="..."> links to individual articles in the HTML below.
{% if selector_hint %}

USE THIS CSS SELECTOR to find article links: {{ selector_hint }}
{% endif %}

## CRITICAL: Different pages have DIFFERENT articles!
This page URL is: {{ page_url }}
- If the URL has ?start=100, articles start from position 100
- If the URL has ?start=1000, articles start from position 1000
- Each listing page has DIFFERENT article URLs - they should NOT be the same!

## DO NOT EXTRACT from these (they're the same on EVERY page):
- Header section with "latest" or "featured" items
- Top navigation with recent articles
- Sidebar recommendations
- Footer links
- Any section labeled "popular", "trending", "recent"

## EXTRACT from the MAIN CONTENT AREA:
- The large repeated list of articles (10-20+ items)
- This is the section that CHANGES when you paginate

## Return JSON:
{
    "article_urls": ["https://example.com/article1", "https://example.com/article2", ...]
}

Expected: 10-30 URLs per page. If you find less than 5, you're probably looking at the header/sidebar!
Convert relative URLs to absolute using base: {{ base_url }}
