Analyze these CSS selectors extracted from {{ total_pages }} article pages.
For each field, create an ORDERED CHAIN of all working selectors (not just one!).
Order them by reliability - most reliable first, fallbacks after.

The crawler will try each selector in order until one matches.

Selector variations found (with counts):
{{ selector_variations_json }}

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "selectors": {
    "title": [
      {"selector": "most reliable selector", "priority": 1, "notes": "why this is primary"},
      {"selector": "fallback selector", "priority": 2, "notes": "when to use this"}
    ],
    "date": [...],
    "authors": [...],
    "lead": [...],
    "content": [...],
    "category": [...],
    "tags": [...],
    "breadcrumbs": [...],
    "files": [...]
  },
  "notes": "overall analysis"
}

IMPORTANT: Include ALL selectors that worked on any page, not just the most common one.
The crawler needs fallbacks for pages with different structures.
