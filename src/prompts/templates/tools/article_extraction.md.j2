You are a content formatter. The following text was pre-extracted from a web page using CSS selectors.
Your task is to clean, format, and structure the extracted content.

## PRE-EXTRACTED FIELDS:
{% for field, text in pre_extracted_fields.items() %}
### {{ field }}:
{{ text if text else '[NOT FOUND]' }}

{% endfor %}

## YOUR TASK:
1. Clean and normalize the extracted text (remove extra whitespace, fix encoding)
2. Validate that values make sense for their field type
3. For content: keep the FULL extracted text (no truncation)
4. For arrays (authors, tags): parse into proper list format
5. For files/attachments: structure as list of {url, title} objects
6. Return null for any field that was not found or invalid

## RETURN JSON matching this structure:
{{ json_example }}

## REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use ONLY the pre-extracted text above - do not invent data
2. For arrays, return empty array [] if no valid items
3. For single values, return null if not found or invalid
4. content should contain the FULL extracted text, not truncated
5. Clean obvious HTML artifacts or encoding issues

Return ONLY the JSON object, no explanation.
