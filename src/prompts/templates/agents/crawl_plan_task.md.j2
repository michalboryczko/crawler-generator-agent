Create a complete crawl plan for: {{ url }}

Execute all 5 phases as defined in your workflow.

## Your Task
Target URL: {{ url }}

1. Run all four sub-agents in order (discovery → selector → accessibility → data_prep)
2. STORE each agent's full result - you will need these for phase 5
3. Pass ALL collected results to plan_generator_agent via `context.collected_information`
4. Generate test.md documentation

## Reminders
- Store target_url to memory first: memory_write("target_url", "{{ url }}")
- Each agent stores specific memory keys - verify they exist before proceeding
- The plan_generator_agent REQUIRES the collected_information array with all 4 agent outputs
- Do NOT skip any agent - all are mandatory for a complete crawl plan

Return summary with:
- Plan file path (from plan_generator_agent response)
- Status of each phase
- Counts: articles discovered, selectors found, test entries created
